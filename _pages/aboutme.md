Hello! I am Rongzhao, a PhD candidate at McMaster University, specializing in Finance with a keen focus on Risk Management and Investment. Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I bring a robust academic and professional background to my research, emphasizing the application of Machine Learning in financial analysis.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked in the financial industry in China, gaining practical insights and hands-on experience. This background enriches my academic research, providing a unique blend of theoretical knowledge and real-world application. My research primarily focuses on developing predictive models for market trends and managing portfolio risks, aiming to uncover lucrative opportunities for progressive organizations. My research endeavors have led to publications in prestigious journals, underscoring my commitment to academic excellence and thought leadership.

I hold an impressive array of qualifications, including CFA, FRM, China Securities Qualification, and China Mid-Class Economist Certificate. These credentials reflect my comprehensive expertise and dedication to the field of finance. Additionally, I am proficient in a suite of analytical tools such as Python, MATLAB, R, Eviews, VBA, and Stata, which are integral to my research and professional activities.

Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active through stargazing, trekking, swimming, and badminton. I am also an avid listener of jazz and R&B music, which provides a perfect balance to my rigorous academic life. Additionally, I had the honor of contributing as an FRM exam item writer, a role that allowed me to further engage with the professional community and contribute to the field's educational standards.
