This paper makes a comprehensive and systematic study of the impact of the relationship among the leading actor, director, and the box office income of a film. We give scores according to the awareness and attention of the leading actor and director from a very influential database, and make multiple linear regression using these data. The result shows that the box office income is related to the expertise of the director. The better the director is, the higher the box office income will be. However, the box office income has little relationship with the leading actor. It's an interesting result because usually many persons believe the quality of actors is the biggest factor for the revenue of the film box office. Therefore, to pursuit higher box office income and better awareness, movie companies' administrators should consider on hiring famous directors in the first place.
