Plenty of researches have shown that the efficiency of Value-at-Risk in risk management may change as the calculation methods and the market condition change. In this paper, MA-60 and MA-250 were used to separate upward, downward and swinging trends. Historical simulation, delta-normal method and Monte Carlo simulation are used to calculate VaR, respectively. Kupiec test and Christoffersen test are used to backtest the results. In delta-normal method and Monte Carlo simulation, EQMA, EWMA and GARCH are used to estimate volatility. Empirical results indicate that VaR with historical simulation tends to overestimate risk. The sharp peak and heavy tail characteristics of returns result in that delta-normal method underperforms Monte Carlo Simulation. VaR calculated by Monte Carlo simulation with volatility estimated by GARCH performs the best in Kupeic test and Christoffersen test.
