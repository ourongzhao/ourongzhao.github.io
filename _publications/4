Abstract: This paper examines the accuracy of target price forecasts made by sell-side analysts, focusing on predicting target price accuracy using machine learning approaches. Utilizing a dataset of target price forecasts for U.S. listed companies from 1999 to 2021, we employ ensemble methods and incorporate market-level, firm-level, and analyst-level information to predict target price accuracy in terms of target price errors and target price achievement. The long-short portfolio constructed based on our predictions significantly outperform the benchmark in terms of cumulative return and Sharpe ratio.
